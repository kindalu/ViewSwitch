This project is for connecting people from diffent background. 
Help people to extend their comfort zone and increase their empathy in a easy way.
comfort zone -> learning zone -> panic zone.


# Future Steps
- <del>Fetch the user likes data from Facebook</del>
- Try to help user manage their likes pages feed. (wish this will make user keep comming back)
- For each user, try to find anonymous partners to extend comfort zone.
- The anonymous partners have a similar set of likes, but not too similar.
- Let the user and partners form a group, let then do some interaction, and change "Viewpoint".
